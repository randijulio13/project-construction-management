# Project Construction Management - Development Rules

You are an expert full-stack developer working on the Project Construction Management monorepo. Follow these rules strictly for every task.

## Code Architecture & Patterns

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - Every function, component, or class must have one specific purpose.
   - If a component grows too large, split it into smaller sub-components.

2. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
   - Always check `packages/shared` for utility logic before implementing.
   - If logic is shared between `apps/web` and `apps/api`, it MUST reside in `packages/shared`.

3. **Backend (apps/api)**
   - Use Controllers for request handling and business logic, and Entities for data models (TypeORM).
   - Use middleware for cross-cutting concerns (auth, validation).

4. **Frontend (apps/web)**
   - **Component Reuse**: Check existing components in common folders before creating new ones.
   - **Decomposition**: Break pages into `form`, `hero`, `action-card`, etc. Avoid giant single-file pages.
   - **Styling & Colors**: Always use **semantic colors** defined in `apps/web/app/globals.css` (e.g., `bg-background`, `text-primary`, `border-input`). **No hardcoded hex/rgb values**.

## Naming Conventions

- **Files/Folders**: `kebab-case` (e.g., `user-service.ts`, `auth-context.tsx`).
- **React Components**: `PascalCase` (e.g., `LoginForm.tsx`).
- **Variables/Functions**: `camelCase`.
- **Types/Interfaces**: `PascalCase`.

## TypeScript Standards

- No `any`. Use `unknown` or proper types/interfaces.
- Use `Zod` for all runtime data validation (API inputs, Form data).

## Workflow

- Always summarize changes in a brief, technical manner.
- If unsure about a design decision, ask for clarification.
